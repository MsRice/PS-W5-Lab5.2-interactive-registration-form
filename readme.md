## Overview
### Scenario
  
Lab 5.2

In this lab, you will build an interactive user registration form. You’ll apply your knowledge of DOM manipulation, event handling, HTML5 and JavaScript form validation, and localStorage. The form will provide real-time feedback to the user and demonstrate how to handle user input effectively and persist simple data.


### Workplace Context

Imagine you’re a junior front-end developer at a startup. Your team is building a new web application, and your first task is to create the client-side functionality for the user registration page. It’s crucial that this form is user-friendly, provides clear validation feedback to prevent errors, and perhaps remembers some basic user input for convenience. This lab simulates that task, focusing on creating a responsive and interactive form.


### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

    - Structure an HTML form with appropriate input fields for registration.
    - Implement real-time input validation using JavaScript event listeners (input event).
    - Use HTML5 validation attributes (e.g., required, type, minlength, pattern).
    - Apply the JavaScript Constraint Validation API to check validity and display custom error messages.
    - Dynamically create and display error messages next to input fields.
    - Handle the form submit event, prevent default submission, and perform final validation.
    - Use localStorage to save and retrieve simple form data (e.g., username).

    
## Built with

- Basic HTML5 markup
- JavaScrript
- CSS

## Reflection Questions

1. How did event.preventDefault() help in handling form submission?
2. What is the difference between using HTML5 validation attributes and JavaScript-based validation? Why might you use both?
3. Explain how you used localStorage to persist and retrieve the username. What are the limitations of localStorage for storing sensitive data?
4. Describe a challenge you faced in implementing the real-time validation and how you solved it.
How did you ensure that custom error messages were user-friendly and displayed at the appropriate times?
